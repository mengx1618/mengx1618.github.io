    <p>I am a big fun of <strong>horror movies</strong>.</p> 
    
    <p>Horror films go back as far as the onset of films themselves, over a 100 years 
        ago. From our earliest days, we use our vivid imaginations to see ghosts in 
        shadowy shapes, to be emotionally connected to the unknown and to fear things 
        that are improbable. Watching a horror film gives an opening into that scary 
        world, into an outlet for the essence of fear itself, without actually being 
        in danger. Weird as it sounds, there's a very real thrill and fun factor in 
        being scared or watching disturbing, horrific images.</p>
    <p>Horror films, when done well and with less reliance on horrifying special 
        effects, can be extremely potent film forms, tapping into our dream states
         and the horror of the irrational and unknown, and the horror within man 
         himself. (The best horror films only imply or suggest the horror in subtle 
         ways, rather than blatantly displaying it, i.e., Val Lewton's horror films.) 
         In horror films, the irrational forces of chaos or horror invariably need to 
         be defeated, and often these films end with a return to normalcy and victory 
         over the monstrous.</p>
    
    <p>Of necessity, the earliest horror films were Gothic in style - meaning that 
        they were usually set in spooky old mansions, castles, or fog-shrouded, dark 
        and shadowy locales. Their main characters have included "unknown," human, 
        supernatural or grotesque creatures, ranging from vampires, demented madmen, 
        devils, unfriendly ghosts, monsters, mad scientists, "Frankensteins," 
        "Jekyll/Hyde" dualities (good against evil), demons, zombies, evil spirits, 
        arch fiends, Satanic villains, the "possessed," werewolves and freaks to even 
        the unseen, diabolical presence of evil.</p>
    <p>Horror films developed out of a number of sources: folktales with devil characters, 
        witchcraft, fables, myths, ghost stories, Grand Guignol melodramas, and Gothic or 
        Victorian novels from Europe by way of Mary Shelley, Victor Hugo or Irish writer 
        Bram Stoker, and American writers Robert Louis Stevenson and Edgar Allan Poe. 
        Oscar Wilde's 1890 Faustian tale The Picture of Dorian Gray and H.G. Wells' 1896 
        story of The Island of Dr. Moreau were adapted into early film versions. In many 
        ways, the expressionistic German silent cinema led the world in films of horror 
        and the supernatural, and established its cinematic vocabulary and style. Many of 
        the early silent classics would be remade during the talkies era.</p>
    <p>This website will show you a cart of horror movies that you may or 
                may not heard of, and it will cover different catogories sorted
                by 3 countries' style: Japan, United States and China.</p> 
    <p>Hope you will enjoy your horror trip...</p>
