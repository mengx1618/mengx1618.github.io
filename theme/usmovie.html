            <p class="aboutp">
                If you glanced at what's come out in the past 20 years, 
                you might think it's the amount of diced body tissue flying 
                around the screen. Horror has always depended on shock value, 
                but what really unsettles us hasn't changed much: an ominous 
                sound from around the corner, an indecipherable figure in the 
                distance, a sense of impending doom as somebody opens a door.

                #1 The Shining （1980）
            </h2>
            <p class="aboutp">
                Stephen King may not be a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of 
                The Shining, but movie fans sure do seem to be. This tale of a family 
                stuck in a snowbound hotel all alone features some of the most 
                terrifying sequences ever, but it's probably Jack Nicholson's gloriously 
                unhinged performance that movie buffs remember the most. Well, Nicholson 
                and those freaky twin girls. And that hedge maze. And that bleeding 
                elevator. And that woman in the shower.

                #2 Rosemary's Baby (1968)
            </h2>
            <p class="aboutp">
                    This one bored me to tears when I saw it as a kid, and there's a 
                    good reason for that: Rosemary's Baby is made for grown-ups. Not 
                    only is Roman Polanski's movie another one of those "drama!" horror
                     films that makes you wait patiently for the scary stuff, but it 
                     also deals with decidedly adult themes like fear of commitment, 
                     fear of impending parenthood, and, of course, fear of freaky-ass 
                     neighbors who may or may not be members of an evil satanic cult.

                #3 The Exorcist (1973)
            </h2>
            <p class="aboutp">
                The original, unquestionable, undisputed great grandpappy of 
                "possession" horror, and one hell of a brutally good time, William 
                Friedkin's The Exorcist is not just one of the scariest films ever 
                made: it's also one of the most well-constructed horror movies of all 
                time. The story of demon-inhabited Regan, her distraught mother, and 
                the two priests working their religious mojo to save her life holds up 
                to repeat viewings -- partially because the horrific set pieces still 
                hold up resoundingly well, and also because the actors create realistic,
                believable characters who are worthy of our empathy.
