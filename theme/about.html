            <p class="aboutp">
                My name is Xue Meng, the creater of this website.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutp">I am originally from a small city in China. 8 years before,
                I came to the United States for college. Minneapolis MN was my first stop, and I went
                to University of Minnesota there. My major was Statistics. After finshing my undergraduate career, I
                went to Miami FL
                for my graguate study and spent one year there. I learned business analytics in the University of
                Miami. I have to say that Miami is one of the most fun city I've ever been. I made
                a lot of good friends there. We hanged out a lot.</p>
            <h2 id="mywork">My Work</h2>
            <p class="aboutp">
                After graduating, I got an offer from MicroSoft Corporation. That was the reason
                why I ended up in Seattle WA. I worked as a Data Analyst there. It was a very valuable
                experience in my whole life, not only because it was my first job, but also because I
                got the opportunity to meet so many cool people and learn so much stuff in my career.
                Unfortunately, after 2 years' working in MicroSoft, I quitted for some personal issue. Right
                now I am a full-time student in Bellevue College, and I am thrive on the study of
                programming language. Though life in school is quite different from that at Microsoft,
                it is full of fun too. And there are also quite a lot stuff to learn.

            <p class="aboutp">
                In this part, I would love to introduce my "children" to you. They
                are two adorable German Sheperds. </p>
            <p class="aboutp">
                The bigger one is Lilly. She is a lovely girl and she is one year
                and a half now. She is like her mama, from Minneapolis as well. The little
                one names Archie, he is half year old. Me and my boyfriend got him this August.
                They are very close brother and sister. They love each other, play
                with each other, chase after each other, sleep next to each other and
                sleep together. One of the hardest thing to do in a day is to go
                to school myself, leaving these 2 angels home. Looking at their "Please
                don't leave" begging eyes, my heart break. So every Friday I take them with
                me to school.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutp">
                I am very grateful to have them in my life. They protect me, listen
                to me, follow me, love me. They are my families in this city. We make
                a lovely family...
